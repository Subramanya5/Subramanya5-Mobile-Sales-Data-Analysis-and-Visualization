# Dataset Exploration
# Data Preprocessing:

How were missing values handled for different columns, and why were specific methods chosen (e.g., filling CustomerID with -1)?
Why was it necessary to recalculate the TotalAmount column, and how was it done?
What is the significance of transforming the PricePerUnit using the mean value within each ProductCategory?

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

What trends were observed in the sales data over time, and how might these trends influence business decisions?
How did the analysis differentiate the impact of discounts on different product categories?
What correlations were discovered between key numerical variables, and how do these correlations aid in understanding the sales dynamics?

# Model Building and Evaluation:

Why was the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model chosen for predicting PricePerUnit, and what were the key features used for the prediction?
What were the results of the model evaluation in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²) values?
How was the accuracy of the model interpreted using R-squared, and what does it suggest about the model's performance?

# Visualization:

What insights were gained from visualizing the actual vs predicted values of TotalAmount?
How did the visualization of sales trends and product category distributions help in understanding customer behavior?

# Application of Insights:

How can the findings from this analysis be applied to develop more effective pricing strategies?
In what ways can businesses utilize the predictive model for future sales and pricing forecasts?
How can the analysis of customer behavior through discounts and price points enhance marketing campaigns?
